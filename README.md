# simpleCalculator
Created a simple calculator using Tkinter

A fairly simple calculator that is able to use simple mathematical operations and trig functions. There is an *input* box and *ans* output box. ValueError and other errors will be produced and outputted into the *input* box for user to see. 

### Examples of how to use the calculator without producing errors are the following:

* > **Input>** `4+20-7`   **Ans>** `17.0` (You can concatenate as much operations as you want, the script will evaulate as you keep pressing the operators, until `operator.eq` is evaluted)

* > **Input>** `ANS+3 / 10`   **Ans>** `2` (You can use previous outputted answer with the 'ANS' button)

* > **Input>** `1 + cos(pi)`  **Ans>** `0`


I tried to incorporate as much flexibility within the input while keeping it simple at the same time. 
> **Please note:** This is my first simple python project I have created that involves a GUI. I have made simple scripts in the past that use simulation approaches to solve certain problems *(ie: problems relating to physics while I was still in my undergrad)*. I am still very new to python and the approaches in this script are probably terrible but I tried to use several approaches based on what I have learned so far: For Loops, Classes, Functions and Methods etc. Creating a Button class to create Buttons is extremely redundant but I wanted to practice my knowledge with classes as well.
